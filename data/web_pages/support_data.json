A fixed transaction fee of \u20b920 + GST is charged for each pledge and unpledge request, regardless of the number of shares. The split is as follows. INR 5 (Depository) + INR 15 (Angel One Charge) + GST For example, Suppose you want to pledge 100 shares of ABC Ltd. and 50 shares of XYZ Ltd. You will be charged \u20b940 + GST for 2 requests, irrespective of the number of shares in each request. Similarly, if you want to place one unpledge request for 100 shares of ABC Ltd. and two unpledge requests for 50 shares and 20 shares of XYZ Ltd, respectively. In this case, you will be charged (\u20b920 x 3) = \u20b960 + GST for 3 requests, irrespective of the number of shares in each request. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

A fixed transaction fee of \u20b920 + GST is charged for each pledge and unpledge request, regardless of the number of shares. The split is as follows. INR 5 (Depository) + INR 15 (Angel One Charge) + GST \u0909\u0926\u093e\u0939\u0930\u0923 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f, Suppose you want to pledge 100 shares of ABC Ltd. and 50 shares of XYZ Ltd. You will be charged \u20b940 + GST for 2 requests, irrespective of the number of shares in each request. Similarly, if you want to place one unpledge request for 100 shares of ABC Ltd. and two unpledge requests for 50 shares and 20 shares of XYZ Ltd, respectively. In this case, you will be charged (\u20b920 x 3) = \u20b960 + GST for 3 requests, irrespective of the number of shares in each request. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Trading & Surveillance Trading & Surveillance Risk Management \u2013 ASM & GSM What is a surveillance measure? Market surveillance plays a key role in ensuring safety and integrity of the markets as it the process of prevention and investigation of abusive, manipulative or illegal trading practices in the securities markets. Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more. What is ASM? SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors\u2019 interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSE here . What is GSM? GSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn\u2019t match with the company\u2019s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming. What is the difference between ASM and GSM? The main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors. What is the basis of categorizing a scrip under ASM? SEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters: 1. High Low Variation 2. Client Concentration 3. Close to Close Price Variation 4. Market Capitalization 5. Volume Variation 6. Delivery Percentage 7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs When will a scrip be classified under GSM? On the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category: 1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities 2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade 3. Persistent Noise Creators 4. Rumour Verification and Clarification in case of Spurt in Price/Volume When will a scrip get out of ASM/GSM? Every 2 months in the case of ASM and every quarter in the case of GSM, the stock can go in and out of the list based on the review carried out by the exchange. What are the surveillance measures under ASM? Please find the detailed surveillance measures under ASM here . Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Risk Management \u2013 ASM & GSM Trading & Surveillance Risk Management \u2013 ASM & GSM Where can we see the complete list of securities under ASM/GSM? The ASM and GSM lists change from time to time. You can see or download the current securities list from the table below. Exchange Category NSE ASM Stocks NSE GSM Stocks BSE ASM Stocks BSE GSM Stocks Does Angel One allow buying and selling of scrips under ASM and GSM? Yes, we allow buying and selling of scrips under ASM and GSM, owing to certain rules and regulations. At Angel, trading is allowed in ASM scrips, while in the case of GSM, only scrips categorised under 0 and 1 are allowed for trading. Why is a particular scrip or scrips blocked from trading? To safeguard the clients from undue loss arising due to monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities such as insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more, particular scrip and scrips are blocked from trading. How much margin is charged for ASM/GSM scrip? The applicable margin while placing orders for ASM/GSM scrip will be 100% in all stages while the price band fluctuates. For GSM: In Stage 1, the applicable margin shall be 100%, while, from Stage 2 onwards, an Additional Surveillance Deposit of 50% or 100% will be applicable based on GSM stage. Note: Please know that clients will not be able to buy stocks that are in stage 2 of GSM or higher. These stocks will require Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of 100% of the trade value or more and this margin will remain blocked by the exchange atleast for 2 months even after the stock is solid. Can I trade in scrips categorized as unsolicited? No, trading in unsolicited scrips is restricted at Angel One. Click here to know more unsolicited investment tips. What are Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA)? What happens when a stock is under the surveillance of either of these codes? Insolvency Bankruptcy Code (IBC): This law is incorporated to handle insolvency and bankruptcy cases. When a stock is under surveillance for IBC, it means the company is going through an insolvency procedure. For some of these stocks, trading may still be allowed subject to the stage of surveillance. Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA): An agreement between various lenders and a single borrower that describes their rights and obligations in case of a default is ICA. When a company has entered into ICA to restructure the debt, its stock comes under the surveillance. In these cases, trading in the stocks might be allowed but with certain restrictions in place. Why are some scrips blocked from trading in Options? Trading is resticted for certain scrips to protect clients from undue loss arising due to liquid counters. Why am I unable to buy/sell SME shares? If the client has bought SME shares through IPO, selling is allowed. However, buying is completely blocked as per the risk and management decision to safeguard clients from undue losses occuring due to liquid counters. Why am I allowed to buy/sell limited quantity? Buying/selling is limited to a particular quantity due to illiquid counters and dry volumes. This restriction also safeguards clients from excess losses. Why are certain scrips allowed to trade only 2 times in a financial year? This criteria is removed from Angel One. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Verifying your mobile number helps us create a secure account for you, ensuring a smooth app experience and the safety of your account. Can I continue if the mobile number linked to my bank is different from the one registered with the app? No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. Why are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required? These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Can I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone? Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Can I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier? Yes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN? No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. Why is my PAN not getting verified? For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it? The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Why is my Aadhar required? Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar? No, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents. What is DigiLocker? DigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers. What should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step? For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry. How can I add a new address as my current address? Use the \u201cadd\u201d button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed. What should I do if I can't change my permanent address? The address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application. Can my permanent address be the same as my current address? Yes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same. Why is video KYC required? Video KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI. What if I am not available during bank working hours? If you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account. When can I complete the Video KYC? Video KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending. What if video KYC fails? You can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails. How will I know the status of my video KYC? Your video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the \u2018My Investments\u2019 tab. What should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification? Retry using the correct details. If it still doesn\u2019t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance. Why are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking? These details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed. Why is my money deducted before video KYC? Your money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days. What is required for completing a video KYC? Keep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Your data is only used for account creation and KYC purposes, and it is not shared with any third parties. The safety of your information is our top priority.

We will use the Digilocker facility to validate your identity and complete KYC by verifying documents like Aadhar and PAN.

A fixed deposit (FD) is a popular and safe investment option in India. You invest a lump sum of money at an agreed interest rate and receive the amount along with interest upon maturity. The interest rates are fixed, higher than a regular savings account, and the investment is protected from market fluctuations. Is it safe to invest in an FD? Yes, FDs are one of the safest investment options. Unlike market-led investments where returns fluctuate, the returns on an FD are fixed at the time of investment. Even if FD interest rates change over time, your FD will grow at the rate you initially booked. What is DICGC and which deposits are secured by them? The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It insures bank deposits, including savings, current, recurring, and fixed deposits, up to Rs. 5 lakh per account holder per bank. This insurance does not cover FDs with NBFCs. Can only banks offer fixed deposits? No, fixed deposits are offered by banks, NBFCs, and the India Post Office. FDs with NBFCs, known as Corporate FDs, often offer higher interest rates compared to banks. What is an NBFC and do they also offer fixed deposits? A Non-Banking Financial Corporation (NBFC) operates as a financial institution without a full banking license, regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Reserve Bank of India. NBFCs offer services like savings, investment plans, lending schemes, insurance, and fixed deposits. What is the minimum and maximum amount I can invest in a fixed deposit? You can start investing in fixed deposits with a minimum amount as low as INR 5000. The maximum amount varies based on the specific FD scheme you choose. Is it mandatory to add a nominee? No, it is not mandatory to add a nominee, but it is recommended. Can I add a nominee who is less than 18 years old? Yes, but you must provide the details of a guardian. Who can I add as a nominee? You can add any individual as a nominee, including family members, relatives, friends, or any trusted person. Can I add or change a nominee later? Yes, you can add or change a nominee later, but this service is currently available only with some partner banks. You will see the \u201cAdd Nominee\u201d option on the dashboard once your FD is successfully booked. What is FD advice? FD advice is a computer-generated statement provided by the bank as proof of ownership or investment when you open a fixed deposit. I do not file taxes. Is there a way for TDS to not get deducted from the FD? Currently, we do not offer a solution to avoid TDS deduction. Some banks allow the filing of forms 15G/15H, but we do not have this functionality. TDS is deducted only if the total interest from all sources with the bank exceeds Rs 40,000 for normal citizens and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens. How are FDs taxed? Interest earnings from your fixed deposit are taxed according to your tax slab. For example, if you are in the 20% tax bracket and you earned Rs 6,000 interest from a 1-year FD of Rs 1 lakh at 6%, you will pay 20% of Rs 6,000, which is Rs 1,200, as tax. Still need help?

A payout account is where your fixed deposit investments will be credited upon maturity. This is the account where you will receive your money back. Can I add someone else's bank account details? No, the payout account should belong to you. We do not allow the use of another person\u2019s account for payout. Please use an account that is in your name. How can I add my bank if it is not in the list? Click on the Search tab, enter your bank name, and you will be able to select your bank to add as the payout account for your fixed deposit. What should I do if my bank is inactive but my bank details are correct? Your payout account must be an active bank account for us to credit the money on maturity or withdrawal. If your bank status is inactive, either add another active bank account or check with your bank regarding your account status. Why did I receive an SMS of INR 1 credit? We verify your bank account by transferring INR 1. This verification process might result in an SMS from your bank informing you about the credit. What should I do if the bank servers are down? Retry after some time or use a different bank account. What if my payment fails? If your payment fails and the amount is deducted, it will be refunded within 2-4 working days. You can place another request for an FD if you are still interested. Why did my payment fail? Third-party limit error: Check your daily online transaction limit in your net banking, as exceeding this limit will cause the transaction to fail. UPI limit error: UPI transactions have a daily limit of Rs 1 lakh. Ensure you are not exceeding this limit. Bank connection error: Sometimes the connection to your bank\u2019s page or UPI app page may break during payment, causing the transaction to fail. What should I do if I haven't received the refund yet? Your money is safe. If you haven\u2019t received the refund within 7 working days, check your bank account statement for refund transactions and ensure 7 working days have passed. What should I do if I am stuck on the payment step and cannot understand the current status? Click on \u201cGo to Dashboard\u201d to track your FDs in the Pending Investments tab. What interest rate will I get in case of a premature withdrawal? For premature withdrawal, the interest rate applicable will be for the tenure the FD was maintained. A penalty rate will also apply, and the net off penalty rate will be the applicable interest rate. When and where will I receive my money in case of a withdrawal? You will receive your money within 2 working days after successfully placing withdrawal instructions to the account details provided during the FD booking process. Are there any withdrawal processing charges? No, there are no withdrawal processing charges. How will I know when my withdrawal is completed? You will receive an SMS or notification from the bank regarding the crediting of money in your account. The FD booking will be automatically removed post-withdrawal. Can I prematurely withdraw my FD? Yes, you can prematurely withdraw your Fixed Deposit with Axis Bank and Utkarsh Bank once the lock-in period is completed. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Verifying your mobile number helps us create a secure account for you, ensuring a smooth app experience and the safety of your account. Can I continue if the mobile number linked to my bank is different from the one registered with the app? No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. Why are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required? These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Can I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone? Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Can I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier? Yes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN? No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. Why is my PAN not getting verified? For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it? The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Why is my Aadhar required? Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar? No, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents. What is DigiLocker? DigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers. What should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step? For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry. How can I add a new address as my current address? Use the \u201cadd\u201d button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed. What should I do if I can't change my permanent address? The address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application. Can my permanent address be the same as my current address? Yes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same. Why is video KYC required? Video KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI. What if I am not available during bank working hours? If you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account. When can I complete the Video KYC? Video KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending. What if video KYC fails? You can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails. How will I know the status of my video KYC? Your video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the \u2018My Investments\u2019 tab. What should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification? Retry using the correct details. If it still doesn\u2019t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance. Why are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking? These details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed. Why is my money deducted before video KYC? Your money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days. What is required for completing a video KYC? Keep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

A fixed deposit (FD) is a popular and safe investment option in India. You invest a lump sum of money at an agreed interest rate and receive the amount along with interest upon maturity. The interest rates are fixed, higher than a regular savings account, and the investment is protected from market fluctuations. Is it safe to invest in an FD? Yes, FDs are one of the safest investment options. Unlike market-led investments where returns fluctuate, the returns on an FD are fixed at the time of investment. Even if FD interest rates change over time, your FD will grow at the rate you initially booked. What is DICGC and which deposits are secured by them? The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It insures bank deposits, including savings, current, recurring, and fixed deposits, up to Rs. 5 lakh per account holder per bank. This insurance does not cover FDs with NBFCs. Can only banks offer fixed deposits? No, fixed deposits are offered by banks, NBFCs, and the India Post Office. FDs with NBFCs, known as Corporate FDs, often offer higher interest rates compared to banks. What is an NBFC and do they also offer fixed deposits? A Non-Banking Financial Corporation (NBFC) operates as a financial institution without a full banking license, regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Reserve Bank of India. NBFCs offer services like savings, investment plans, lending schemes, insurance, and fixed deposits. What is the minimum and maximum amount I can invest in a fixed deposit? You can start investing in fixed deposits with a minimum amount as low as INR 5000. The maximum amount varies based on the specific FD scheme you choose. Is it mandatory to add a nominee? No, it is not mandatory to add a nominee, but it is recommended. Can I add a nominee who is less than 18 years old? Yes, but you must provide the details of a guardian. Who can I add as a nominee? You can add any individual as a nominee, including family members, relatives, friends, or any trusted person. Can I add or change a nominee later? Yes, you can add or change a nominee later, but this service is currently available only with some partner banks. You will see the \u201cAdd Nominee\u201d option on the dashboard once your FD is successfully booked. What is FD advice? FD advice is a computer-generated statement provided by the bank as proof of ownership or investment when you open a fixed deposit. I do not file taxes. Is there a way for TDS to not get deducted from the FD? Currently, we do not offer a solution to avoid TDS deduction. Some banks allow the filing of forms 15G/15H, but we do not have this functionality. TDS is deducted only if the total interest from all sources with the bank exceeds Rs 40,000 for normal citizens and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens. How are FDs taxed? Interest earnings from your fixed deposit are taxed according to your tax slab. For example, if you are in the 20% tax bracket and you earned Rs 6,000 interest from a 1-year FD of Rs 1 lakh at 6%, you will pay 20% of Rs 6,000, which is Rs 1,200, as tax. Still need help?

What should I do if my bank is inactive but my bank details are correct? Your payout account must be an active bank account for us to credit the money on maturity or withdrawal. If your bank status is inactive, either add another active bank account or check with your bank regarding your account status. Why did I receive an SMS of INR 1 credit? We verify your bank account by transferring INR 1. This verification process might result in an SMS from your bank informing you about the credit. What should I do if the bank servers are down?

What interest rate will I get in case of a premature withdrawal? For premature withdrawal, the interest rate applicable will be for the tenure the FD was maintained. A penalty rate will also apply, and the net off penalty rate will be the applicable interest rate. When and where will I receive my money in case of a withdrawal? You will receive your money within 2 working days after successfully placing withdrawal instructions to the account details provided during the FD booking process. Are there any withdrawal processing charges? No, there are no withdrawal processing charges. How will I know when my withdrawal is completed? You will receive an SMS or notification from the bank regarding the crediting of money in your account. The FD booking will be automatically removed post-withdrawal. Can I prematurely withdraw my FD? Yes, you can prematurely withdraw your Fixed Deposit with Axis Bank and Utkarsh Bank once the lock-in period is completed. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

IPO IPO OFS Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) Stock SIP Where can I find my UPI ID? Generally, you can find your UPI ID in the profile section of the respective app you are using. I don\u2019t have a UPI ID. Can I apply for an IPO? In case you don\u2019t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list. Alternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form. How can I create my UPI ID? You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App Verify your mobile number Register the passcode (it is required to open the app) Select your bank from the options available The app will fetch your bank details In case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM Set up a UPI PIN for security Now you can check your UPI ID in the profile section. Why am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle? For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed. In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. Why can\u2019t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO? In case you can\u2019t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO. Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. When will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order? Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App \u2013 Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not. In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One\u2019s Application OR Make sure your Payments App is updated. OR If it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one\u2019s application and place a new bid. How to approve an IPO mandate request? You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. By when can I approve the UPI mandate request? Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. What are the charges of applying for an IPO? With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. How can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app? NRI\u2019s can not apply via the Angel One app. However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. What is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price? Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors. This price is ascertained at the allotment stage. When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price. In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply? You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. Can I apply for an IPO using my bank\u2019s current account? It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account. You need to check with your bank for more details. Can I apply for an IPO using my HUF\u2019s account? You cannot apply via the Angel One app. However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. My daughter is a minor. Can I apply for an IPO using her account? The Angel One app doesn\u2019t allow a minor to apply. Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. Why didn\u2019t my account get debited after applying for an IPO? As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account. If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date. Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds. If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank . Can I modify my IPO bid? Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order. Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid. You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid. However, if you haven\u2019t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Why is my IPO application rejected? Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN When will my funds be blocked and unblocked? Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO. Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment? We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN Applying at cut-off price Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application? Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date. Why didn\u2019t I get my IPO allotment? Common reasons why you didn\u2019t get the allotment are Non-Allotment \u2013 Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection \u2013 Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons: 1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN 2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN 3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Is tax applicable on profit from an IPO? Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket. When is the next IPO coming? Visit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO\u2019s. I have approved the mandate request, but the status on the Angel One app is still pending. What to do? Your UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time. It will reflect shortly in your IPO order book. Can I withdraw/delete/cancel my IPO bid? For an IPO application process in the Angel One app, withdrawing, deleting, and canceling the application is the same thing. Follow the below path to withdraw/cancel your IPO application Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order you wish to cancel Tap on cancel & confirm to cancel your IPO Order How can I check my IPO application status? Follow the below path to check your IPO application status Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the application status Your IPO application status will be visible from here Where to check the IPO allotment status? Follow the below path to check your subscription status Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the subscription status Your IPO subscription status will be visible from here Can I submit multiple applications for an IPO? Only 1 application per PAN is recommended. Even if you apply via different platforms using the same PAN, your application will be rejected and you will not get the IPO allotment. However, you can increase the chances of IPO allotment by applying with different account linked to different PAN. For example, you can apply with your and your parents demat account separately.

The repayment schedule is not available on the app. You can request your repayment schedule by: Emailing at: support@creditsaison-in.com Calling: 18001038961 What happens if I miss an EMI? Will ECS bounce charges be levied? Yes, if you miss an EMI, a bounce charge of INR 450 will be applied. Do I get email/SMS reminders from the Banks before my EMI date? Lenders will send EMI reminders before the due date via call and WhatsApp. Do I have the option of part prepayment of the loan? Are there any charges for it? No, part prepayment of the loan is not available currently. How do I check my payment statement online? You can check your payment statement online under the \u2018Loans\u2019 tab. All details for verification, tracking, and managing your loans will be available there once the loan is approved. What happens if I don't pay back OR miss EMI repayments on the Loan? If you miss or fail to repay your EMIs on the loan, it can negatively affect your credit score and may lead to additional charges or legal action. We strongly urge you to avoid missing your loan monthly installment payments. How can I pay my missed EMI or foreclose the loan? If your EMI is not cleared from your bank account via the auto debit E-NACH mandate on the due date due to inadvertent circumstances, you can pay it yourself through the Angel One app. Follow these steps: Open the Angel One app. Navigate to the loan pass book. Use the \u201cPay Now\u201d section to make the payment via net banking or debit card. Alternatively, the EMI mandate will be represented for auto debit from your bank account. To foreclose the loan, you can also use the Angel One app to find the option to foreclose and complete the payment using the same methods. How can I change my bank account used for repaying the EMI? Presently, we do not have the feature to facilitate the change of the bank account used to set up the EMI mandate. We urge you to continue servicing your EMI through the bank account that was used at the time of loan disbursement. When can I foreclose my loan? Your eligibility for foreclosure varies depending on the lender partner. Please check your loan documents for specific details regarding foreclosure eligibility and conditions. Still need help?

Margin Trading Facility Available Margin to Trade Margin Pledge/Unpledge Margin Trading Facility What is Margin Trading Facility (MTF)? Margin Trading Facility (MTF) allows an investor to buy a stock by paying just a fraction of the total transaction value. The balance amount is funded by the broker. As an illustration Your Account Balance = Rs. 25,000 MTF gives you upto 4x buying power = Rs 100,000 (25,000 x 4) Thus, your enhanced Buying Capacity is now = Rs. 125,000. What is Margin required? Margin required is the amount you need to pay initially to buy stocks under margin products. Margin amount can be paid either in the form of Cash, or by pledging your holdings (margin pledge). What happens if the margin is less? In order to buy stocks under Margin Trading Facility, you need to fulfil the Minimum Margin requirement. If your margin is less than that, then you will have to add funds to proceed with your transaction. What is the interest rate charged for using MTF? A standard interest rate of 0.041% per day (14.97% per annum) is charged on the borrowed amount. How long can I hold the stocks purchased via MTF? In case you have pledged the shares, you can hold them as long as you want unless you either sell your Pay Later (MTF) positions or convert them to delivery by adding funds. When will I start incurring interest charges? Interest is levied from the 2nd day onwards after you placed an MTF trade, till the outstanding amount is cleared, and/or your position is squared-off. What is MTF Pledge? As per SEBI guidelines, your shares bought using PayLater (MTF) will be automatically pledged . There is no action needed from your end When would my shares purchased under MTF be squared-off? For shares purchased under MTF, square-off will be triggered in either of the below scenarios: If there is a margin shortfall, shares will be squared-off 4 trading days after the shortfall has occurred. What are the charges for Pledging/Un-pledging shares under MTF? When you raise a request to Pledge or Unpledge your shares, charge of Rs 20/- plus GST is levied per scrip. How is MTF Pledge different from Margin Pledge? Margin Pledge means using your existing holdings / portfolio to get additional limit / margin. You can then use this additional margin for Equity Intraday, futures & options writing (equity and currency F&O). As per SEBI guidelines, shares bought under MTF have to be compulsorily pledged. This is called MTF pledge. Unlike Margin Pledge, you do not get additional limit against these shares. Can Margin Trading Facility be used for trading in Futures & Options, Currency, or Commodity segment? No. MTF Facility is applicable for trading in equity shares only. I do not want to use Margin Facility. What should I do? If you do not wish to use Margin facility you can place orders using Delivery product type.

I got less money than what I placed an withdrawal order for? Your withdraw amount is converted to corresponding units while placing order at exchange. We calculate the units to be withdrawn based on current NAVs. Mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days) For example, on June 3rd, you will see the NAV for June 2nd. Consider the following scenario for withdraw order placed on June 3rd: If NAV on 3rd June > 2nd June, You will receive an amount greater than order amount. If NAV on 3rd June < 2nd June, You will receive an amount lesser than order amount. In Summary, you will receive an amount according to latest NAV. Will my next instalment be auto-debited? Your next SIP instalment will be Auto-Debited from your bank account if you have a valid Auto-pay setup. If not please setup an Autopay so that your future SIP instalments can be automated. To setup an Autopay, Please click below: {Setup Autopay} What is Stamp duty? The government collects 0.005% of the overall purchase amount of any mutual fund scheme as stamp duty. So even if entire amount is debited from your bank account, 0.005 percent of total amount is deducted and hence when order is completed, Same is reflected as invested amount. Still need help?

Investments Orders SIPs Investments My latest investment is not showing up in investments? Your Investments will appear in your \u2018Investments\u2019 Tab when your orders moves to \u2018Completed\u2019 section of your Orders Tab. This happens when we get the confirmation of Unit allotment by respective AMCs. This process generally takes 3/4 working days from order placement date. Your portfolio updation date in Order timeline is our estimate of when Unit allotment confirmation from AMC will come through. Please do not worry, This date date does not have any relation to your NAV date. Your NAV date depend on realization of funds by AMC. My Current value is not updated? our Current Value for mutual fund portfolio are calculated based by latest NAVs of funds held by you. Mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days) This means that the Current value you see on a particular day reflects the exact current value as per previous working day. For example, on June 3rd, you will see the Current Value for June 2nd. The Current Value for June 3rd will be updated later on June 3rd, after the market closes. Therefore, throughout June 3rd, you will view the Current value from June 2nd. On June 4th, you will see Current Value of June 3rd. As Saturdays and Sundays are considered holidays (along with other market holidays), there are no updates to the Current values on these days as NAV does not change. However, certain special mutual funds (such as FoF) have their NAV updated once a week. So they current value might change if you hold these funds. My Mutual fund NAV is not updated Mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days) This means that the NAV you see on a particular day reflects the value from the previous working day. For example, on June 3rd, you will see the NAV for June 2nd. The NAV for June 3rd will be updated later on June 3rd, after the market closes. Therefore, throughout June 3rd, you will view the NAV from June 2nd. On June 4th, you will see NAV of June 3rd.

I got less money than what I placed an withdrawal order for? Your withdraw amount is converted to corresponding units while placing order at exchange. We calculate the units to be withdrawn based on current NAVs. Mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days) For example, on June 3rd, you will see the NAV for June 2nd. Consider the following scenario for withdraw order placed on June 3rd: If NAV on 3rd June > 2nd June, You will receive an amount greater than order amount. If NAV on 3rd June < 2nd June, You will receive an amount lesser than order amount. In Summary, you will receive an amount according to latest NAV. How do I import my external funds on Angel One?

Bonus Issue Bonus Issue Buyback Dividend Holdings/Portfolio Rights Issue Stock Split TPIN What is Bonus Issue? Bonus shares are additional shares given by the company to existing shareholders, free of cost, in proportion to the shares held by the shareholder. Who is eligible for bonus shares? Shareholders who own shares of the company on the record date set by the company are eligible for bonus shares. When will the Bonus shares be credited in my demat account? The bonus shares will get credited to your demat account 10-15 days after the record date. In case you do not receive the same post 15 days from the Record date you can check the status with the Registrar (RTA). You can find the details of the Registrar on the BSE India website by visiting the Corp Information section. Why has the average price of the stock reduced after receiving bonus shares? The buy price of bonus shares is zero, as they are credited at no cost. When the shares are credited to your account, the quantity of shares increases while the invested value remains unaffected. As a result, the average price of the stock reduces. Be assured that it is correctly calculated by Angel One. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Rights Issue Bonus Issue Buyback Dividend Holdings/Portfolio Rights Issue Stock Split TPIN How to apply for a Rights Issue? Investors can apply for Right Issue shares only through the Application Supported by Blocked Amount i.e. ASBA, either online or offline, if they hold Right Entitlement in their demat account. Online ASBA Process: Most Self-Certified Syndicate Banks (SCSBs) support the online ASBA application process through Net Banking, similar to an IPO application. Investors should refer to their respective SCSB\u2019s website for detailed instructions on applying for the Rights Issue. Offline ASBA Process: Alternatively, investors can apply by submitting a filled application form at the nearest branch of an SCSB (Self Certified Syndicate Bank). The list of eligible branches is available on the SEBI website . The Composite Application form (CAF) can be downloaded from NSE, BSE and RTA websites. Investors can also view and download the Rights Issue Application Form (CAF) , Offer Letter, Abridged Letter & Entitlement Ratio \u2013 Applicable only for registered holders with holdings as of Record Date, from the RTA website. RTA don\u2019t directly accept Right Issue application forms (online/offline). Application needs to be channeled through SCSBs only. How to obtain the Right Entitlement (RE) ? Directly from RTA if the investor is eligible for the Right Issue by holding shares of the Company on the record date . Purchasing from the Market \u2013 Investors can buy Right Entitlement (RE) from the secondary market through the trading platforms such as Angel One, generally identifiable with \u201c-RE\u201d at the end of the stock symbol. Important Note: Holding or purchasing Right Entitlement (RE) does not automatically grant ownership of the Rights Issue shares. Investors must apply for the Rights Issue using their RE before the application deadline. Failure to do so will result in the renouncement of rights, leading to a loss of value. The RTA website is only for viewing the Rights Issue Application Form, Offer Letter, Abridged Letter & Entitlement Ratio \u2013 Applicable only for registered holders with holdings as of Record Date.

Investors can apply for Right Issue shares only through the Application Supported by Blocked Amount i.e. ASBA, either online or offline, if they hold Right Entitlement in their demat account. Online ASBA Process: Most Self-Certified Syndicate Banks (SCSBs) support the online ASBA application process through Net Banking, similar to an IPO application. Investors should refer to their respective SCSB\u2019s website for detailed instructions on applying for the \u0920\u0940\u0915 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e. Offline ASBA Process: Alternatively, investors can apply by submitting a filled application form at the nearest branch of an SCSB (Self Certified Syndicate Bank). The list of eligible branches is available on the SEBI website . The Composite Application form (CAF) can be downloaded from NSE, BSE and RTA websites. Investors can also view and download the \u0920\u0940\u0915 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e Application Form (CAF) , Offer Letter, Abridged Letter & Entitlement Ratio \u2013 Applicable only for registered holders with holdings as of Record Date, from the RTA website. RTA don\u2019t directly accept Right Issue application forms (online/offline). Application needs to be channeled through SCSBs only. How to obtain the Right Entitlement (RE) ? Directly from RTA if the investor is eligible for the Right Issue by holding shares of the Company on the record date . Purchasing from the Market \u2013 Investors can buy Right Entitlement (RE) from the secondary market through the trading platforms such as Angel One, generally identifiable with \u201c-RE\u201d at the end of the stock symbol. Important Note: Holding or purchasing Right Entitlement (RE) does not automatically grant ownership of the \u0920\u0940\u0915 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e shares. Investors must apply for the \u0920\u0940\u0915 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e using their RE before the application deadline. Failure to do so will result in the renouncement of rights, leading to a loss of value. The RTA website is only for viewing the \u0920\u0940\u0915 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e Application Form, Offer Letter, Abridged Letter & Entitlement Ratio \u2013 Applicable only for registered holders with holdings as of Record Date.

To give you the margin benefit, the required margin for the entire basket will be calculated using the SPAN calculator. What if the available margin is less than the required margin? You can add the funds with the \u2018Add Funds\u2019 feature within the Basket to match the required margin. What will happen to my basket after execution? After placing the Basket Order, the status of individual orders will be shown inside the basket. You can take decisions at the individual order level like modifying a pending order or retrying a failed order. Can I see my placed Basket Order the next day? If you have saved your basket, then you can see it the next day, but the orders will be reset to the initial state i.e., before placing the Basket Order. However, you won\u2019t be able to see the status of the orders. Please know that if you don\u2019t manually save the basket, it will not appear in the Baskets Tab. What is the margin benefit in the Basket? When you place individual orders, you do not get a hedging benefit and have to pay the entire required margin upfront. But when you hedge your position in the basket (i.e. combine 2 or more orders), you get the benefit of hedging in terms of lower required margin. Can the basket save time in order execution? You can save time using Basket Order as multiple orders are placed in one click. So, there is no need to place and execute individual orders. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Your position could have been squared off due to any of the below reasons: Intraday trades will auto squared off at 3:15 pm for the Cash segment and at 3:20 for the F&O segment. Intraday trades will be squared off if you lose 80% of your Available Margin. When you don\u2019t maintain the minimum required margin in your account your shares will be squared off 4 days after the shortfall occurs. When your shares bought using Margin are down by more than 50% of your fund balance, square-off\u00a0will be done on the next trading day. Shares bought under Margin Product need to be fully paid or pledged, failing which the shared will be squared off after 7 days. \u092f\u0926\u093f \u0906\u092a\u0915\u093e \u0916\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0921\u0947\u092c\u093f\u091f/\u0928\u0947\u0917\u0947\u091f\u093f\u0935 \u092c\u0948\u0932\u0947\u0902\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u0905\u0902\u0924\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0924 \u091a\u0932\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0924\u094b \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0947 \u0936\u0947\u092f\u0930 7 \u0926\u093f\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u090f \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0917\u0947\u0964 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u0907\u0902\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0921\u0947 \u092a\u094b\u091c\u0940\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u091a\u0941\u0915\u0924\u093e \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e? \u0909\u0938 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0949\u0915 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u090a\u092a\u0930\u0940/\u0928\u093f\u091a\u0932\u0947 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0915\u093f\u091f \u0915\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0940 \u0916\u0930\u0940\u0926/\u092c\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0938\u092e\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092f\u0926\u093f \u0906\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0949\u0915 \u0916\u0930\u0940\u0926\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0936\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u0932\u094b\u0905\u0930 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0915\u093f\u091f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0947 \u0936\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u0905\u0917\u0932\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u092c\u0947\u091a\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0917\u0947\u0964 \u092f\u0926\u093f \u0906\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0936\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u0915\u092e \u092c\u0947\u091a\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u0936\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0930 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0915\u093f\u091f \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u0936\u0947\u092f\u0930 \u0928\u0940\u0932\u093e\u092e \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u093f\u090f \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0917\u0947\u0964 Still need help?

Square Off Watchlist Basket Order Order Status Placing an Order Robo order Square Off Stop loss order Types of Orders Limit order Margin Calculator Options Order Rejection What are the timings for Intraday Square-Off? Below are the timings for Intraday Square-Off: Equity Segment: 3:15 pm Futures Options Segment: 3:20 pm Currency Segment: 4:45 pm Commodity Segment: 11:15/11:45 pm ( Depending on Daylight Savings Time) Why was my position squared off? Your position could have been squared off due to any of the below reasons: Intraday trades will auto squared off at 3:15 pm for the Cash segment and at 3:20 for the F&O segment. Intraday trades will be squared off if you lose 80% of your Available Margin. When you don\u2019t maintain the minimum required margin in your account your shares will be squared off 4 days after the shortfall occurs. When your shares bought using Margin are down by more than 50% of your fund balance, square-off\u00a0will be done on the next trading day. Shares bought under Margin Product need to be fully paid or pledged, failing which the shared will be squared off after 7 days. If your account goes under debit/negative balance, then your shares will be squared off after 7 days. Why was my Intraday Position not squared off? Your buy/sell position might not be squared off due to upper/lower circuit in that stock. In case you have bought the stock and the share is in a lower circuit your shares will be sold the next day. In case you have short sold the share there is in upper circuit on the share the shares will be auctioned. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Stop loss order Watchlist Basket Order Order Status Placing an Order Robo order Square Off Stop loss order Types of Orders Limit order Margin Calculator Options Order Rejection When I am trying to exit my position or place a Stop-Loss order, why is it being rejected? It may happen if you have a pending Stop-Loss (SL) or an exit order already. With an already pending stop-loss or exit order, you will need extra funds to be able to place a duplicate SL/exit order. If you do not have this extra fund in your account, then your duplicate exit order will get rejected. That\u2019s why we inform you while exiting if there\u2019s a Pending SL/exit order against a position, to avoid any duplicate orders and rejections. My Stop-Loss (SL) order was triggered but it did not get executed. Why did this happen? There could be 2 major reasons behind this: The asset may be lacking a buyer/seller at the defined stop-loss limit price due to a lack of market depth. Orders are queued while they are being purchased or sold. a. For example: Let\u2019s say there are 50 buyers and 100 sellers who are waiting to trade on a scrip at \u20b990. Upon reaching \u20b990, the first 50 sellers\u2019 orders will be executed, and the remaining 50 sellers will have to wait for new buyers. In case you are one of those remaining 50 sellers, your sell order will remain pending if there are no corresponding buyers and vice versa. The price movement during high volatility does not fulfill certain criteria e.g. suppose you have placed a sell stop-loss with trigger Price at \u20b9100 and limit price at \u20b9100. Now imagine that the LTP touched \u20b9100 (here, the SL would be triggered) and quickly went below \u20b9100 due to high volatility. The limit price of \u20b9100 means the stop-loss order would get executed at only \u20b9100 or more. Now this order will be pending as price is below Rs 100 and execution will happen only when price has reached or crossed Rs 100. Hence your stop-loss order was not executed. Due to this reason, we recommend keeping a sufficient gap between the trigger price and limit price to increase the chances of Stop Loss execution during high volatility. Note: In order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price. This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn\u2019t be a hindrance and the order should still get executed. Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility. My stop-loss order got triggered even though the predefined Trigger Price had not appeared. Why? Chances are that the market price did hit the stop-loss price, albeit momentarily and without you being able to spot it at that moment. Within a second, prices can change multiple times and not all of them are relayed to the Brokers by Exchange, especially during high volatility. As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere. Price matching and execution of the orders\u00a0 is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker. What is Stop Loss? Stop-loss is a tool that investors use to minimise the loss in a trade. Some traders define it as an advance order, which triggers an automatic closure of an open position when the stock price reaches the trigger price level. Stop loss helps minimise losses but also limit profits from a trade. What is Trailing Stop Loss? A Trailing Stop-loss is an order that lets you set a maximum value or percentage of loss you can incur on a trade. If the securiy price rises or falls in your favour, the trigger price jumps with it at the set value or percentage. If the security price rises or falls against you, the trigger price stays in place depending on the nature of the order. How does a Stop-loss get triggered? Stop-loss can be your real saviour during a volatile market condition. A price level set at the beginning of the trade allows traders to close their position automatically when the stop-loss is reached. Squaring off takes place at the next price available at the trigger price level and helps limit losses. What is the 1% rule of trading? The 1% rule defines the maximum limit of risk one can take in a trade or the risk-per-trade. It implies adjusting your position so that total loss doesn\u2019t cross 1% of your trade value when the stop-loss is triggered. The 1% rule helps avoid significant losses. Can I use stop-loss in trading with the AngelOne Trading app? You can place a Stop loss order\u00a0 in AngelOne mobile app by following the below simple steps: Visit the AngelOne app and select the stock to Buy/Sell Select quantity of the trade Set\u2019 Trigger price\u2019 Enter the price where you want to place stop-loss Confirm the stop-loss price, click on \u201cBuy/Sell\u201d and confirm the order Still need help?

Limit order Watchlist Basket Order Order Status Placing an Order Robo order Square Off Stop loss order Types of Orders Limit order Margin Calculator Options Order Rejection Why doesn't my Limit order get executed after I reach the price I want? It does not guarantee that your order will be executed even if your price has been reached. Orders are queued while being bought or sold. For Example. Assume you placed a Buy limit order of 100 Rs for the ABC script. Let\u2019s say there are 100 buyers and 50 sellers waiting to trade in ABC at 100. ABC is currently trading at 105 Rs and after a few minutes, it reaches 100 Rs. Since there are only 50 sellers for 100 Rs, only 50 buyers will be able to buy the script once this price is reached. As for the other 50 buyers, they\u2019ll have to wait until more sellers become available. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Trading & Surveillance Trading & Surveillance Risk Management \u2013 ASM & GSM What is a surveillance measure? Market surveillance plays a key role in ensuring safety and integrity of the markets as it the process of prevention and investigation of abusive, manipulative or illegal trading practices in the securities markets. Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more. What is ASM? SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors\u2019 interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSE here . What is GSM? GSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn\u2019t match with the company\u2019s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming. What is the difference between ASM and GSM? The main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors. What is the basis of categorizing a scrip under ASM? SEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters: 1. High Low Variation 2. Client Concentration 3. Close to Close Price Variation 4. Market Capitalization 5. Volume Variation 6. Delivery Percentage 7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs When will a scrip be classified under GSM? On the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category: 1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities 2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade 3. Persistent Noise Creators 4. Rumour Verification and Clarification in case of Spurt in Price/Volume When will a scrip get out of ASM/GSM? Every 2 months in the case of ASM and every quarter in the case of GSM, the stock can go in and out of the list based on the review carried out by the exchange. What are the surveillance measures under ASM? Please find the detailed surveillance measures under ASM here . Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

No need to issue cheques by investors while subscribing to IPO. Just write the bank account number and sign in the application form to authorise your bank to make payment in case of allotment. No worries for refund as the money remains in investor's account.

Verifying your mobile number helps us create a secure account for you, ensuring a smooth app experience and the safety of your account. Can I continue if the mobile number linked to my bank is different from the one registered with the app? No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. Why are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required? These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Can I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone? Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Can I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier? Yes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN? No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. Why is my PAN not getting verified? For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it? The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Why is my Aadhar required? Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar? No, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents. What is DigiLocker? DigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers. What should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step? For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry. How can I add a new address as my current address? Use the \u201cadd\u201d button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed. What should I do if I can't change my permanent address? The address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application. Can my permanent address be the same as my current address? Yes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same. Why is video KYC required? Video KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI. What if I am not available during bank working hours? If you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account. When can I complete the Video KYC? Video KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending. What if video KYC fails? You can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails. How will I know the status of my video KYC? Your video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the \u2018My Investments\u2019 tab. What should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification? Retry using the correct details. If it still doesn\u2019t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance. Why are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking? These details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed. Why is my money deducted before video KYC? Your money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days. What is required for completing a video KYC? Keep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

IPO IPO OFS Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) Stock SIP Where can I find my UPI ID? Generally, you can find your UPI ID in the profile section of the respective app you are using. I don\u2019t have a UPI ID. Can I apply for an IPO? In case you don\u2019t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list. Alternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form. How can I create my UPI ID? You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App Verify your mobile number Register the passcode (it is required to open the app) Select your bank from the options available The app will fetch your bank details In case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM Set up a UPI PIN for security Now you can check your UPI ID in the profile section. Why am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle? For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed. In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. Why can\u2019t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO? In case you can\u2019t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO. Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. When will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order? Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App \u2013 Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not. In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One\u2019s Application OR Make sure your Payments App is updated. OR If it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one\u2019s application and place a new bid. How to approve an IPO mandate request? You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. By when can I approve the UPI mandate request? Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. What are the charges of applying for an IPO? With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. How can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app? NRI\u2019s can not apply via the Angel One app. However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. What is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price? Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors. This price is ascertained at the allotment stage. When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price. In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply? You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. Can I apply for an IPO using my bank\u2019s current account? It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account. You need to check with your bank for more details. Can I apply for an IPO using my HUF\u2019s account? You cannot apply via the Angel One app. However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. My daughter is a minor. Can I apply for an IPO using her account? The Angel One app doesn\u2019t allow a minor to apply. Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. Why didn\u2019t my account get debited after applying for an IPO? As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account. If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date. Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds. If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank . Can I modify my IPO bid? Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order. Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid. You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid. However, if you haven\u2019t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Why is my IPO application rejected? Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN When will my funds be blocked and unblocked? Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO. Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment? We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN Applying at cut-off price Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application? Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date. Why didn\u2019t I get my IPO allotment? Common reasons why you didn\u2019t get the allotment are Non-Allotment \u2013 Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection \u2013 Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons: 1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN 2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN 3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Is tax applicable on profit from an IPO? Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket. When is the next IPO coming? Visit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO\u2019s. I have approved the mandate request, but the status on the Angel One app is still pending. What to do? Your UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time. It will reflect shortly in your IPO order book. Can I withdraw/delete/cancel my IPO bid? For an IPO application process in the Angel One app, withdrawing, deleting, and canceling the application is the same thing. Follow the below path to withdraw/cancel your IPO application Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order you wish to cancel Tap on cancel & confirm to cancel your IPO Order How can I check my IPO application status? Follow the below path to check your IPO application status Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the application status Your IPO application status will be visible from here Where to check the IPO allotment status? Follow the below path to check your subscription status Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the subscription status Your IPO subscription status will be visible from here Can I submit multiple applications for an IPO? Only 1 application per PAN is recommended. Even if you apply via different platforms using the same PAN, your application will be rejected and you will not get the IPO allotment. However, you can increase the chances of IPO allotment by applying with different account linked to different PAN. For example, you can apply with your and your parents demat account separately.

The repayment schedule is not available on the app. You can request your repayment schedule by: Emailing at: support@creditsaison-in.com Calling: 18001038961 What happens if I miss an EMI? Will ECS bounce charges be levied? Yes, if you miss an EMI, a bounce charge of INR 450 will be applied. Do I get email/SMS reminders from the Banks before my EMI date? Lenders will send EMI reminders before the due date via call and WhatsApp. Do I have the option of part prepayment of the loan? Are there any charges for it? No, part prepayment of the loan is not available currently. How do I check my payment statement online? You can check your payment statement online under the \u2018Loans\u2019 tab. All details for verification, tracking, and managing your loans will be available there once the loan is approved. What happens if I don't pay back OR miss EMI repayments on the Loan? If you miss or fail to repay your EMIs on the loan, it can negatively affect your credit score and may lead to additional charges or legal action. We strongly urge you to avoid missing your loan monthly installment payments. How can I pay my missed EMI or foreclose the loan? If your EMI is not cleared from your bank account via the auto debit E-NACH mandate on the due date due to inadvertent circumstances, you can pay it yourself through the Angel One app. Follow these steps: Open the Angel One app. Navigate to the loan pass book. Use the \u201cPay Now\u201d section to make the payment via net banking or debit card. Alternatively, the EMI mandate will be represented for auto debit from your bank account. To foreclose the loan, you can also use the Angel One app to find the option to foreclose and complete the payment using the same methods. How can I change my bank account used for repaying the EMI? Presently, we do not have the feature to facilitate the change of the bank account used to set up the EMI mandate. We urge you to continue servicing your EMI through the bank account that was used at the time of loan disbursement. When can I foreclose my loan? Your eligibility for foreclosure varies depending on the lender partner. Please check your loan documents for specific details regarding foreclosure eligibility and conditions. Still need help?

Bonus Issue Bonus Issue Buyback Dividend Holdings/Portfolio Rights Issue Stock Split TPIN What is Bonus Issue? Bonus shares are additional shares given by the company to existing shareholders, free of cost, in proportion to the shares held by the shareholder. Who is eligible for bonus shares? Shareholders who own shares of the company on the record date set by the company are eligible for bonus shares. When will the Bonus shares be credited in my demat account? The bonus shares will get credited to your demat account 10-15 days after the record date. In case you do not receive the same post 15 days from the Record date you can check the status with the Registrar (RTA). You can find the details of the Registrar on the BSE India website by visiting the Corp Information section. Why has the average price of the stock reduced after receiving bonus shares? The buy price of bonus shares is zero, as they are credited at no cost. When the shares are credited to your account, the quantity of shares increases while the invested value remains unaffected. As a result, the average price of the stock reduces. Be assured that it is correctly calculated by Angel One. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?
